## Ella

Ella is a minimalist machine learning framework with use numpy as backend,
the aim of ella project is create a minimalist machine learning framework that
work in runtime like a simple python script, this in pro of create in a fast
and simple way some ANN architecture

**### *For the moment ella has the following features**

1. *****Activation Functions**
2. **Layers** (only have feed forward algorithms)
3. **Models** (only have sequential model)


### Next implementation
- Backpropagation
